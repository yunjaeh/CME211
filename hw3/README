# input and output
    Input :
        - path to the directory containing data files

    Output :
        - chord length
        - pressure coefficients in Cartesin coordinates (Cx,Cy)
        - lift coefficient (Cl)
        - stagnation point and pressure


# Description : 
This module analyzes given data set (coordinates and pressure coefficient)
and finds characteristics (outputs like chord, Cl, stagnation point)
of several angle of attack.

Angle of attack is the inflow direction to an airfoil, which determines
the characteristics: 

- Pressure coefficient is non-dimensional pressure.
It is important because the difference in the pressure between
lower and upper parts of an airfoil generates lift force.
Provided pressure coefficient decomposed into two components in cartesian coordinates.

- Decomposed pressure coefficient are used for computing lift coefficient
(lift coefficient is related to the lift force)

- The location and pressure of stagnation points.
(The point indicates a )



# Programming description
Input file should have a name in specific form.
And it considers several error handling :
    reading files
    reading inputs
    




# Class airfoil includes methods :

    airfoil.__init__
        initialize variables used in the class
        

    airfoil.__repr__
        generate list of output lines
        for printing results in tablular form


    airfoil.read_flist
        read the list of files under given path


    airfoil.read_xy
        read x and y coordinates from xy.dat file

    airfoil.cal_chord
        compute chord length of an airfoil


    airfoil.read_cp
        read pressure coefficients of each angle of attack


    airfoil.cal_cxyl
        decompose pressure coefficient into  x and y components (cx and cy)
        computes lift coefficient using cx and cy

    airfoil.find_stag_pt
        find stagnation point(a point has maximum pressure along the airfoil)
