# HW6, write up

The code includes functionalities required in the instruction.
"image.cpp" consists of one function "Convolution" and one class "Image".

"Convolution":
    computes the convolution between input img file and kernel.
    (kernel size should be odd, it throws error if even-size kernel is given)
    It does not process the data near four edges. 
    Edges are processed in the image class after running this function,
    based on the method of the class calling this function.
    

"Image":
    is consist of three methods: BoxBlur, Save and Sharpness.

    - BoxBlur : 
    makes input image blur, various size of kernel can be used.
    (kerner size should be odd and greater than 1 
    to avoid error occuring in "Convolution" function)

    - Save : 
    Saves a image file using given function in hw6.cpp

    - Sharpness :
    computes the sharpness of the image using Laplacian operator as a kernel.
